TARGETED FIXES SUMMARY

Domain Mode Implementation
- Added domain mode as first-class concept: LEARNING (default), REVISION, POLISH
- Difficulty prioritization branches first by domain mode, then by domain type
- All existing difficulty logic preserved and extended, not replaced
- LEARNING: Fundamentals hard-first with failure backoff, Coding readiness-based
- REVISION: Prioritizes overdue items and recently failed attempts (attempt-derived, not time-based)
- POLISH: Prioritizes recall, refinement, and confidence-building
- Files: src/core/domainMode.js (new), src/core/difficulty.js (restructured)

Fundamentals Failure Backoff
- Strictly attempt-based: tracks failure streak from attempts data only
- Increments on failed attempts (Stuck/Skipped), resets to 0 on Solved/Partial
- Computes effectiveDifficulty = baseDifficulty - min(1.5, failureStreak * 0.5)
- Fundamentals sorted exclusively by effectiveDifficulty (no time-based logic)
- Files: src/core/difficulty.js, src/hooks/useAttempts.js

Pattern-Level Readiness for Coding
- Aggregates readiness across items sharing same pattern when metadata exists
- Uses pattern readiness when available, falls back to item-level readiness
- Attempts recorded at item level only
- Files: src/hooks/useAttempts.js, src/core/sessionOrchestrator.js

Preserved Invariants
- Zero-trust mutation rules unchanged
- Session composition remains exactly 3 units
- Coverage debt formula unchanged
- No new UI screens, settings, or flows added
