- Fixed client/server API mismatches (extra userId args) that broke item/attempt loading and domain updates, restoring correct data flow.
- Removed time-based review windows and added deterministic tie-breakers in prioritization to guarantee same inputs yield the same session.
- Added attempt-derived signals (recentlyFailed, isOverdue, needsRefinement, confidence) and used them in revision/polish logic so mode behavior is actually enforced.
- Computed minutesDoneLast7d deterministically from attempt data to drive coverage debt as specified.
- Introduced schema fingerprinting with snapshots + confirmation gating, and blocked session start until schema changes are explicitly confirmed.
- Converted unknown-domain mapping to a confirmable, low-cognitive flow with max-3 suggestions instead of long lists.
- Simplified the entry screen to “Start Today’s Session” with only duration, focus, and start (no dashboard/preview).
- Marked rescue completions as Partial (not Solved) to respect failure-backoff semantics.
- Added required SQLite tables (learning_items, sessions, metadata) and migrated existing items to learning_items.
- Removed Notion extension residue (background proxy + manifest permissions/description) to align with no-Notion policy.
