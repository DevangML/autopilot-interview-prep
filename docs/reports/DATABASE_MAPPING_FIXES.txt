DATABASE MAPPING SAFETY FIXES

Discovery as Proposal
- Changed from auto-decision to proposal requiring confirmation
- prepareDatabaseMapping returns proposal with validation flags
- Auto-accept only high-confidence single-DB mappings (≥ 0.7)
- Files: src/services/notionDiscovery.js

Confidence-Based Validation Gates
- ≥ 0.7: auto-accept (single DB per domain)
- 0.4-0.7: warn and require confirmation
- < 0.4: block auto-mapping
- Multiple DBs per domain: always require confirmation
- Files: src/services/notionDiscovery.js

Multiple Databases Per Domain
- Changed mapping from domain → single ID to domain → ID array
- Session orchestrator aggregates items across all DBs for a domain
- Files: src/core/sessionOrchestrator.js, src/services/notionDiscovery.js

Hardened Attempts Database Detection
- Detects by schema signature only (Item relation + Result select + Time Spent number)
- Fails loudly if zero or more than one attempts DB found
- Never auto-selects arbitrary attempts DB
- Files: src/services/notionDiscovery.js

Schema Fingerprinting
- Generates fingerprint from property names + types + CPRD presence
- Detects schema changes and forces re-analysis
- Files: src/services/notionDiscovery.js

Confirmation UI
- DatabaseMappingConfirmation component shows proposal with warnings
- Reuses existing confirmation flow patterns (zero-trust)
- Files: src/components/DatabaseMappingConfirmation.jsx, src/InterviewPrepApp.jsx

Preserved Invariants
- Zero-trust mutation rules unchanged
- No silent auto-fixes
- No new UI screens (reuses confirmation flows)
- Session composition and coverage logic unchanged
