EXTERNAL PROGRESS LOGGING - IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY

WHAT WAS ADDED:
• Database table: external_attempts (system-owned, append-only)
• Backend API endpoints: GET, POST, DELETE /external-attempts
• Frontend hook: useExternalAttempts (manages external attempt state)
• UI Components: ProgressView, ExternalProgressLog
• Coverage integration: External minutes weighted at 40% max impact
• Data store methods: fetchExternalAttempts, createExternalAttempt, deleteExternalAttempt

HOW IT INTEGRATES:
• Coverage calculations: External attempts contribute to coverage debt via weighted minutes (40% weight)
• Progress View: Shows internal vs external contributions separately
• Session orchestration: External attempts influence coverage debt but do NOT select items
• Readiness signals: External attempts can contribute to readiness (weighted at 40% max)
• Revision triggers: External "Stuck" outcomes can trigger revision scheduling

HOW IT DOES NOT INTEGRATE:
• Does NOT auto-complete curated items
• Does NOT mutate learning_items or items tables
• Does NOT directly select session items
• Does NOT override internal attempt history
• Does NOT create false confidence spikes
• Does NOT activate Custom Mode
• Does NOT trigger automatic dataset upgrades

INVARIANTS PRESERVED:
• Zero-trust mutation: External attempts are system-owned (auto-write allowed)
• Deterministic orchestration: External data only influences, never overrides
• Session composition: Still exactly 3 units, same selection logic
• Coverage debt formula: Extended but not changed (added externalMinutesLast7d parameter)
• Domain mode system: External failures can push toward REVISION, success alone cannot push to POLISH
• Attempt-based backoff: External attempts do NOT affect failure streaks (internal only)

EDGE CASES HANDLED:
• Empty external attempts: Gracefully handles missing data
• Domain mismatch: External attempts filtered by domain correctly
• Time calculations: 7-day window enforced, minutes estimated from outcomes
• Weighting: External impact capped at 40% to prevent overpowering internal signals
• UI state: Progress view shows clear separation of internal vs external
• Form validation: All required fields enforced, outcome must be valid enum

CONSTANTS:
• EXTERNAL_WEIGHT: 0.4 (40% max impact)
• External minute estimates: Solved=30min, Partial=20min, Stuck=15min
• Seven-day window: 7 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000 ms
