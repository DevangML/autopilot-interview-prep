FINAL HARDENING TWEAKS

Attempts Database Detection Extra Guard
- Added validation requiring Result select includes "Solved" option
- Fails loudly with specific error if missing, blocks orchestration (no silent fallback)
- Files: src/services/notionDiscovery.js

Domain Classification Confidence Floor
- Enforced minimum 0.6 confidence when CPRD + domain-typical props + learning-sheet structure align
- Reduces unnecessary warn+confirm cases for well-structured databases
- Title-only cap remains 0.5 unchanged
- Files: src/services/notionDiscovery.js

Preserved Invariants
- Existing thresholds unchanged, zero-trust/proposal-only/determinism preserved
- No new UI screens or settings added
