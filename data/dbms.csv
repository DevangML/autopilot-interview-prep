What is a DBMS? Advantages over File System,Introduction,"DBMS = software to store, retrieve, and manage data in databases. Advantages: Reduces redundancy, enforces integrity, allows concurrent access with security. Solves file system issues (no central control, data inconsistency).",P0,https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-dbms/
Primary Key vs Foreign Key,Data Modeling,"**Primary Key**: unique identifier for table rows (no duplicates, not NULL). **Foreign Key**: a field in one table that references the primary key of another – enforces referential integrity (must match an existing PK or be NULL).",P0,https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/database-keys/
"Normalization (1NF, 2NF, 3NF, BCNF)",Data Modeling,Process to reduce data redundancy. **1NF**: atomic columns (no multivalue). **2NF**: + every non-key fully depends on whole primary key. **3NF**: + no transitive dependencies (non-key depends on non-key). **BCNF**: every determinant is a candidate key. Normalization prevents update anomalies,P0,https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/normal-forms-in-dbms/
"SQL Joins (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL)",SQL Querying,**INNER JOIN**: only matching rows. **LEFT JOIN**: all rows from left + matching from right (unmatched right = NULL). **RIGHT JOIN**: vice versa. **FULL JOIN**: all rows from both sides (NULL for non-matches). Understand join outputs and use cases.,P0,https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sql-join-set-1-inner-left-right-and-full-joins/
SQL Query for Nth Highest (example),SQL Querying,"Common interview SQL: e.g. ""find 2nd highest salary"". Solution: `SELECT MAX(Salary) FROM Employee WHERE Salary < (SELECT MAX(Salary) FROM Employee);`. Or use `ORDER BY Salary DESC LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1` (in some SQL). Practice writing queries for top-N, group-by, etc.",P1,https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sql-query-to-find-the-nth-highest-salary/
ACID Properties of Transactions,Transactions,"**Atomicity**: all-or-none. **Consistency**: transactions bring DB from one valid state to another. **Isolation**: concurrent transactions don't interfere (as if serialized). **Durability**: once committed, persists even if system fails",P0,https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/acid-properties-in-dbms/
Transaction Isolation Levels,Transactions,"Different levels trade off consistency vs performance: **Read Uncommitted** (dirty reads allowed), **Read Committed** (no dirty reads), **Repeatable Read** (no non-repeatable reads; phantom reads possible except in MySQL/InnoDB), **Serializable** (no phantoms, fully isolated). Know phenomena like dirty read, non-repeatable read, phantom.",P1,https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/transaction-isolation-levels-dbms/
Indexes (B-Tree Indexing),Performance,"Index = data structure (often B-tree or B+ tree) to speed up lookups on a column. Improves read performance significantly by log N factor, but adds write overhead (maintaining index). Understand that an index on a key allows quick search, but too many indexes slow inserts.",P0,https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/indexing-in-databases-set-1/
SQL vs NoSQL,Database Types,"**SQL (relational)**: structured schema, ACID transactions, uses SQL (e.g. MySQL, PostgreSQL). **NoSQL**: schema-less or flexible schema, for unstructured data or massive scale (e.g. MongoDB = document store, Cassandra = wide-column). NoSQL trades some consistency for scalability (often eventual consistency in distributed systems). Choose based on use-case (complex joins -> SQL, large scale horizontal -> NoSQL).",P1,https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-sql-and-nosql-databases/
Denormalization & Indexing for Performance,Performance,Denormalization = intentionally introduce redundancy (merge tables) to reduce joins and improve read speed (common in data warehousing). Use when read performance and simplicity outweigh update costs. Also consider caching query results. Always balance with data integrity considerations.,P2,https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/denormalization-in-databases/
Aggregate Functions and GROUP BY,SQL Querying,"Be comfortable with `GROUP BY` queries (COUNT, SUM, AVG, etc.) and HAVING clause for conditions on aggregated results. E.g. ""find department with max employees"" or ""count orders per region having count > X"". Remember: WHERE filters rows before grouping, HAVING filters groups after aggregation.",P0,https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sql-having-clause/
Difference: DELETE vs TRUNCATE vs DROP,SQL Querying,"**DELETE**: removes rows one by one (can have WHERE, logged individually, can rollback). **TRUNCATE**: bulk delete all rows in table, faster (non-logged in detail, minimal rollback capability, resets identity). **DROP**: remove entire table schema and data. Usually asked to know which is DML vs DDL and effects on transactions.",P0,https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-delete-truncate-and-drop-in-sql/
What is a JOIN vs UNION,SQL Querying,**JOIN**: combine columns from multiple tables into one result (horizontally). **UNION**: combine results of two queries (vertically stack result sets) – must have same number of columns. UNION by default removes duplicates (UNION ALL keeps duplicates).,P2,https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-join-and-union-in-sql/
Stored Procedures vs Functions,SQL Programming,"Both are database programmable objects. **Stored Procedure**: may not return a value, can perform actions (INSERT/UPDATE), allow output parameters, invoked with CALL/EXEC. **Function**: returns a value or table, primarily for computations in queries (cannot have side effects on DB state in many systems).",P2,https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-stored-procedures-and-functions-in-sql/
Database Transactions vs Locks,Transactions,"A transaction may use locks to ensure isolation. Locks: shared (read) vs exclusive (write). Understand that high-level transaction ensures ACID, while locks are low-level mechanism to prevent interference (e.g. row locks, table locks). Know common issues: deadlock (two transactions waiting on each other's locks) – DBMS will detect and rollback one.",P1,https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/lock-based-protocol-in-dbms/
