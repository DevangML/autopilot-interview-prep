Name,Behavioral Weight,Coding Questions,DSA Depth,Duration,Evaluation Focus,Medium,Prep Tips,Source Link,System Design Presence,Tool/Format,Typical Stage Name,What Makes It Different vs OA
Amazon,Medium (Leadership Principles),1-2,Medium to Hard (core patterns),~45-60 min,Problem solving + LP signal + communication,Video/phone,Practice LP stories; narrate tradeoffs; confirm constraints; test quickly.,https://igotanoffer.com/blogs/tech/amazon-software-development-engineer-interview,Sometimes light (role-dependent),Shared editor (varies),Phone screen (technical),"More interactive: questions, hints, tradeoffs; LP probing integrated."
Google,Low to Medium,1,Medium to Hard; emphasis on clarity,~45 min,Correctness + reasoning + collaboration,Video,Restate problem; propose approach; analyze complexity; handle edge cases.,https://igotanoffer.com/blogs/tech/google-software-engineer-interview,Rare on first screen,Google Docs/CoderPad style (varies),Technical phone screen,OA is timed and solitary; phone screen rewards communication and structured thinking.
Meta,Low,2 (often),Medium (speed-focused),~45 min,Speed + correctness + pattern mastery,Video,Pattern drill; timeboxing; speak while coding; verify with examples.,https://igotanoffer.com/blogs/tech/meta-facebook-software-engineer-interview,No on screen,Shared editor,Technical screen,OA measures completion; screen measures how you think while coding under time.
Microsoft,Medium,1-2,Medium; sometimes puzzle/edge-case heavy,~45-60 min,Problem solving + culture (growth mindset),Video/phone,Ask clarifying questions; propose multiple approaches; be coachable.,https://igotanoffer.com/blogs/tech/microsoft-software-engineer-interview,Usually no on first screen,Shared editor or interview platform,Technical screen,More conversational than OA; interviewer may pivot based on your choices.
Uber,Medium,1-2,Medium; implementation rigor,~45-60 min,Practical coding + tradeoffs + integrity,Video/phone,Focus on correctness first; write clean code; discuss tradeoffs and failure modes.,https://igotanoffer.com/blogs/tech/uber-software-engineer-interview,Sometimes light (depending on role),Shared editor,Technical phone screen,Often more pragmatic than OA; may emphasize robustness and assumptions.
Atlassian,Medium (values later),1-2,Medium; implementation + data structures,~60 min,Communication + correctness + collaboration,Video,Talk through design; write readable code; incorporate feedback quickly.,https://www.interviewing.io/guides/atlassian-interview-process,Usually no on first screen,Pair-coding style (varies),Technical screen,"Less like exam, more like pair problem solving; values alignment matters later."
