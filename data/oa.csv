Name,Behavioral/Workstyle Component,Common Pitfalls,OA Platform (common),Question Types,Role Track,Sections (what shows up),Source Link,Tips (high ROI),Typical Time
Amazon,Yes (Work Simulation + Work Style),Ignoring Work Style consistency; overfitting to 'what they want' inconsistently; sloppy tests in coding.,Amazon OA (often via third-party),"2 coding problems (DSA patterns) + workplace scenarios (prioritization, customer focus) + preferences questionnaire",SDE Intern/New Grad,Coding assessment + Work Simulation + Work Style Assessment (varies by role),https://www.amazon.jobs/en/landing_pages/application-and-assessment-faq,"Treat Work Simulation like leadership principles in action; for coding, optimize after correctness; write clean edge-case handling.",Varies (often 60-120 min total across parts)
Atlassian,Sometimes (separate values round later),Spending too long perfecting first problem; missing edge cases; not reading constraints.,CodeSignal / HackerRank (commonly),Implementation-heavy + 1-2 DSA pattern problems; input parsing and correctness matter,SWE (varies),Timed coding screen (often multi-question),https://codesignal.com/resource/general-coding-assessment/ ; https://www.interviewing.io/guides/atlassian-interview-process,Prioritize full score on easy/medium; write robust parsing; build small helper functions; test quickly.,Often ~70 minutes (platform-dependent)
TCS,Sometimes (role-dependent modules),Over-investing time in one section; skipping instructions; weak typing/IO handling in coding.,TCS iON / TCS NQT portal,MCQs + coding tasks (variant-dependent),NQT (entry-level),Foundation: Verbal + Reasoning + Numerical; Advanced: higher difficulty sections; Programming section (as applicable),https://www.tcs.com/careers/india/tcs-national-qualifier-test,"Do sectional time-boxing; maximize accuracy in MCQ; for coding, aim at passing all sample + hidden edge cases.",Varies by test variant
Google,Usually no (behavioral in interviews),Jumping into code; unclear problem restatement; missing constraints.,Varies (HackerRank/Docs/Custom),1-2 algorithmic problems emphasizing clarity and correctness,SWE (early career),Coding assessment or take-home style screen (not universal),https://igotanoffer.com/blogs/tech/google-software-engineer-interview,Write clear approach first; discuss complexity; handle edge cases explicitly; avoid premature micro-optimizations.,Varies (often 60-90 min if present)
Meta,Usually no (behavioral later),Silent coding; weak testing; no complexity discussion.,Varies (often coding screen platform),"DSA-heavy, leetcode-like; speed matters",SWE,Coding assessment (may precede phone screen in some pipelines),https://igotanoffer.com/blogs/tech/meta-facebook-software-engineer-interview,Drill common patterns (arrays/strings/hashmaps/graphs); practice communicating while coding.,Varies
Microsoft,Usually no (behavioral later),Assuming one 'right' interpretation; not asking clarifying questions; ignoring constraints.,Varies (Codility/HackerRank/others),DSA problems + debugging-style tasks (occasionally),SWE,Coding assessment may appear before recruiter or before phone screen (pipeline-dependent),https://igotanoffer.com/blogs/tech/microsoft-software-engineer-interview,Explain tradeoffs; write readable code; add tests; keep calm if prompt is underspecified.,Varies
Uber,Usually no (behavioral later),Overengineering; weak edge cases; ignoring runtime constraints.,Varies (HackerRank/CodeSignal/others),"Implementation + DSA; sometimes domain-flavored (data, maps, matching)",SWE,Coding screen or practical take-home (role-dependent),https://igotanoffer.com/blogs/tech/uber-software-engineer-interview,Clarify input/output; write production-grade handling; mention tradeoffs; keep it simple.,Varies
