OOP vs Procedural Programming,Basics,"OOP models real-world with objects; Procedural uses routines/functions. OOP offers encapsulation/inheritance/polymorphism – helps manage larger software better (modularity, reuse).",P2,https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/interview-prep/oops-interview-questions/#difference-between-structured-and-oop
Class vs Object,Basics,"Class is a blueprint/definition (e.g. Car class); Object is an instance of a class (e.g. a specific Car). Class defines attributes & methods, objects have actual values/state",P0,https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-object-and-class/
Encapsulation (Data Hiding),Principles,"Encapsulation = bundling data with methods, and restricting direct access to some of an object's components. Achieved via access modifiers (private fields, public getters/setters)",P0,https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-abstraction-and-encapsulation-in-java-with-examples/
Abstraction (Interface),Principles,Abstraction = exposing only essential features and hiding implementation details. E.g. using an `List` interface without knowing internal code. Achieved via abstract classes or interfaces.,P0,https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-abstraction-and-encapsulation-in-java-with-examples/
Inheritance (IS-A),Principles,"Inheritance = one class derives from another, reusing and extending behavior. Supports hierarchy (e.g. class Dog extends Animal). Enables code reuse; watch for Liskov Substitution (subclasses should be usable via base type).",P0,https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/interview-prep/oops-interview-questions/#what-is-inheritance
Polymorphism (many forms),Principles,"""One interface, multiple implementations."" **Compile-time polymorphism**: method overloading (same name, different params). **Run-time polymorphism**: method overriding in subclass (dynamic dispatch)",P0,https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/polymorphism-in-java/
Method Overloading vs Overriding,Principles,"**Overloading**: same method name, different signature (resolved at compile time). **Overriding**: subclass provides new implementation of base class method (runtime binding). Overriding needs inheritance; overloaded methods are in same class.",P0,https://www.tutorialspoint.com/difference-between-method-overloading-and-method-overriding-in-java
Access Specifiers (public/private/etc),Language Features,"`public`: visible everywhere; `private`: visible only inside class; `protected`: visible in subclass (and same package in Java). Use private for encapsulation – internal fields hidden, access via public methods.",P1,https://www.studytonight.com/cpp/access-modifiers.php
Abstract Class vs Interface,Language Features,"**Abstract class**: can have method implementations and state, but can't instantiate (may have abstract methods). **Interface**: purely abstract methods (Java 8+ can have defaults). Use interface for full abstraction/multiple inheritance of type; use abstract class for base with default behavior.",P1,https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/interview-prep/oops-interview-questions/#difference-between-abstract-class-and-interface
Multiple Inheritance & Diamond Problem,Advanced OOP,"C++ allows multiple inheritance (class A, B -> class C inherits both). **Diamond problem**: ambiguity when two parent classes have a common base. Java avoids multiple inheritances of classes to prevent this. Interfaces in Java (no state) avoid diamond issues or use virtual inheritance in C++.",P1,https://www.scaler.com/topics/diamond-problem-in-cpp/
Constructors and Destructors,Language Features,"Constructor: special method to initialize new object (same name as class, called once on creation). Supports overloading. Destructor (in C++): called on object deletion to free resources. In Java/C#, garbage collector calls finalize (rarely used). Ensure deep copies if needed in copy constructors.",P1,https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/constructors-c/
SOLID Design Principles,Design Principles,"**S**ingle Responsibility, **O**pen/Closed, **L**iskov Substitution, **I**nterface Segregation, **D**ependency Inversion. These five guide good OOP design – e.g. one class = one purpose; favor composition over tightly-coupled dependencies",P2,https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/solid-principles-with-real-life-examples/
Singleton Pattern (Single Instance),Design Patterns,Ensure only one instance of a class globally (e.g. for config or caches). Typically implemented with a private constructor and a static `getInstance()` method. Beware multi-threading (use double-checked locking or `synchronized`).,P2,https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/singleton-design-pattern-in-java/
Shallow vs Deep Copy,Advanced OOP,**Shallow copy**: copies field values as-is (pointers still refer to original object's data). **Deep copy**: duplicates all referenced objects too. Important for classes with pointers: define copy constructor & clone properly to avoid two objects sharing same sub-object,P2,https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-shallow-and-deep-copy-of-a-class/
