OSI Model Layers (7-layer model),Networking Basics,"Layers: **Physical** (bits, cables), **Data Link** (frames, MAC, switches), **Network** (packets, IP, routing), **Transport** (segments, TCP/UDP, port #s), **Session** (connections, dialog control), **Presentation** (encryption, format), **Application** (protocols like HTTP/FTP). Remember examples at each layer.",P0,https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/layers-of-osi-model/
TCP vs UDP (Transport Protocols),Networking Basics,"**TCP**: connection-oriented, reliable (ACKs, retransmissions, order guaranteed), slower. **UDP**: connectionless, unreliable (no delivery guarantee, out-of-order possible), faster, good for real-time (e.g. video, DNS queries). Know use cases: TCP for web/DB, UDP for streaming/DNS.",P0,https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/differences-between-tcp-and-udp/
What happens when you type a URL?,Web (HTTP/DNS),"High-level flow: **DNS lookup** (URL’s domain to IP), **TCP handshake** (TCP 3-way handshake with server on port 80/443), **HTTP request** (GET page), **Server responds** with content, **TLS handshake** if HTTPS, **Browser renders** (may make additional requests for assets). Mention ARP to get MAC on local network and that multiple protocols are involved (DNS, ARP, TCP, HTTP).",P0,https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-happens-when-we-type-url-in-browser/
DNS (Domain Name System) Basics,Web (HTTP/DNS),"DNS resolves human-readable names to IP addresses. Works as a distributed hierarchy: **recursive resolver** asks root → TLD → authoritative name server. Know record types: A (IPv4 address), AAAA (IPv6), CNAME (alias), MX (mail server). Typically a DNS query is UDP (port 53) by default (TCP for large responses).",P1,https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/domain-name-system-dns-in-application-layer/
HTTP vs HTTPS,Web (HTTP/DNS),"**HTTP**: plaintext protocol for web. **HTTPS**: HTTP over TLS/SSL encryption (uses certificates, asymmetric key handshake then symmetric cipher for session). HTTPS ensures encryption, authentication (server identity via cert), and integrity. Runs on port 443 instead of 80. Slight overhead for TLS handshake but essential for security.",P1,https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/differences-between-http-and-https/
Router vs Switch vs Hub,Network Devices,"**Hub**: old, physical layer device, broadcasts incoming bits to all ports (no traffic isolation). **Switch**: data link layer device, learns MAC addresses and switches frames to the correct port (unicast), separates collision domains. **Router**: network layer device, routes packets by IP, connects different networks (separate broadcast domains). Router uses routing tables, can do NAT for internet access.",P0,https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-switch-and-router/
IP Addressing (IPv4 vs IPv6),Networking Basics,"IPv4: 32-bit address (e.g. 192.168.0.5), ~4.3 billion addresses, uses dot-decimal notation, supports fragmentation, limited address space (hence NAT). IPv6: 128-bit, huge address space, hexadecimal notation, built-in IPSec, no need for NAT. Understand concept of subnet mask (IPv4) – e.g. /24 means 255.255.255.0.",P1,https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-ip-addressing-and-subnetting/
Subnetting and CIDR,Networking Basics,"Subnetting: dividing a network into smaller networks. CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) notation (e.g. /26) indicates network mask length. Key skill: determine number of subnets or hosts from a mask. E.g. /24 -> 256 addresses (254 usable). Possibly asked: “Given /x, how many hosts?” or “Design subnets for requirement X.”",P2,https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-subnetting/
Three-Way Handshake (TCP Connection),Networking Basics,"**TCP 3-way handshake**: Client sends SYN (with seq = x), Server replies SYN+ACK (seq = y, ack = x+1), Client sends ACK (ack = y+1). After that, connection established. Ensure understanding that this establishes initial sequence numbers and that teardown is FIN/ACK (4-way).",P0,https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/tcp-3-way-handshake-process/
MAC vs IP Address,Networking Basics,"**MAC**: Media Access Control address – hardware address of NIC (e.g. 48-bit, unique on LAN). **IP address**: logical address for network layer routing. MAC is used for delivery on local network (Ethernet), IP used to route between networks. ARP resolves IP->MAC on local segment.",P1,https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-mac-address-and-ip-address/
Ping and Traceroute,Networking Basics,"**ping**: uses ICMP Echo Request/Reply to test reachability and round-trip time. Good for basic connectivity check. **traceroute**: finds path by sending packets with increasing TTL, routers along path send ICMP Time Exceeded revealing their IP. Understand these are diagnostic tools (if ping fails could mean ICMP blocked or host down).",P2,https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-ping-works/
Difference: LAN vs WAN vs MAN,Networking Basics,"**LAN**: Local Area Network (small scope, one building or campus, typically Ethernet). **WAN**: Wide Area Network (large geographic areas, interconnect LANs, often via ISPs, slower links). **MAN**: Metropolitan Area Network (city-wide, intermediate scope). Likely expecting just definitions and examples (LAN – office network; WAN – Internet).",P2,https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/types-of-area-networks-lan-man-and-wan/
Firewall and NAT,Basic Security/Packets,**Firewall**: network security device (or software) that filters traffic by rules (can be at various layers – packet filters vs application firewalls). **NAT**: Network Address Translation – maps private IPs to a public IP (and port) for internet access. Allows many devices to share one public IPv4. NAT breaks end-to-end addressing – requires protocols like STUN for P2P behind NAT.,P1,https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/network-address-translation-nat-types/
SMTP vs FTP vs HTTP (common protocols),Networking Basics,"These are Application-layer protocols: **HTTP** (HyperText Transfer Protocol) for web, uses TCP 80/443. **FTP** (File Transfer Protocol) for file transfer, TCP 20/21, has separate control and data connections. **SMTP** (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) for email sending, TCP 25. The question expects knowing their purposes and ports.",P2,https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/application-layer-internet-protocols/
