Process vs Thread Basics,Process Management,"Difference in memory & context: processes have separate memory, threads share process memory; threads are lighter for concurrency",P0,https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-process-and-thread/
CPU Scheduling (FCFS/SJF/RR/etc),Process Management,"Know how First-Come-First-Serve, Shortest Job First, Round Robin, etc. work and their pros/cons (FCFS can starve long jobs, RR adds time quantum etc.)",P0,https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/cpu-scheduling-in-operating-systems/
Synchronization & Critical Sections,Concurrency,Multiple threads/processes need mutual exclusion to avoid race conditions; protect critical sections using locks (mutex/semaphore),P0,https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/operating-systems/introduction-of-process-synchronization/
Semaphore vs Mutex Difference,Concurrency,"**Semaphore**: signaling mechanism (can allow multiple threads); **Mutex**: locking mechanism (exclusive, with owner). Mutex is binary semaphore with ownership and stricter access",P0,https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/operating-systems/difference-between-binary-semaphore-and-mutex/
Deadlocks (Conditions & Prevention),Deadlocks,"Deadlock requires 4 Coffman conditions (mutual exclusion, hold & wait, no preemption, circular wait). Prevention/avoidance: break one condition (e.g. use resource ordering)",P0,https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-deadlock-in-operating-system/
Banker's Algorithm (Deadlock Avoidance),Deadlocks,Resource-allocation algorithm to avoid deadlock by checking for a safe state before allocating. Understand safety sequence check,P2,https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/operating-system-bankers-algorithm/
Virtual Memory & Paging,Memory Management,Use disk as “virtual” extension of RAM. Paging divides memory into fixed-size pages/frames to load only needed pages. Know page table concept and addressing,P0,https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/operating-system-virtual-memory/
Page Replacement Algorithms,Memory Management,"When page fault and memory full: FIFO, LRU, Optimal algorithms decide which page to swap out. Know Belady’s anomaly (FIFO) and that LRU approximates optimal",P1,https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/page-replacement-algorithms-in-operating-systems/
Paging vs Segmentation,Memory Management,"Paging: fixed-size pages, no external fragmentation. Segmentation: variable segments, fits logical divisions but can cause external fragmentation",P1,https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-paging-and-segmentation/
Memory Fragmentation (Internal/External),Memory Management,**Internal**: wasted space inside fixed partitions/pages (process smaller than block). **External**: free memory is split into small holes over time,P1,https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-internal-and-external-fragmentation/
User Mode vs Kernel Mode (System Calls),OS Architecture,"OS runs in **kernel mode** (full HW access), user apps in **user mode** (limited). Switching via system calls/traps to perform privileged operations",P1,https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/operating-systems/windows-os-fundamentals/ (User vs Kernel section)
File Systems & Inodes,Storage/Persistent FS,"Inode is metadata structure storing file attributes and disk block pointers (in UNIX). Understand how files are organized (directories, FAT vs NTFS concepts)",P2,https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/file-systems-in-operating-system/
Disk Scheduling Algorithms,Storage/Persistent FS,"Disk head scheduling: e.g. FCFS, SSTF, SCAN (elevator), C-SCAN. Know that SSTF can starve far cylinders, SCAN reduces seek time by back-and-forth sweep",P2,https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/disk-scheduling-algorithms/
Dining Philosophers Problem,Classic Concurrency,Five philosophers share 5 chopsticks – illustrates need for avoiding deadlock (e.g. using odd/even resource ordering or a semaphore for max 4 philosophers eating),P1,https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dining-philosophers-problem-in-operating-system/
Producer-Consumer (Bounded Buffer),Classic Concurrency,"One producer, one consumer share fixed buffer. Use synchronization (mutex for buffer access + two semaphores: “empty” and “full”) to avoid overflow/underflow",P1,https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/producer-consumer-problem-in-operating-system/
Thrashing (Excessive Paging),Memory Management,Thrashing = CPU spending more time swapping pages in/out than executing. Caused by working set too large for RAM. Mitigation: working set model or increase RAM,P2,https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/operating_system_thrashing.htm
